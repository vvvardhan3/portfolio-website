        <div class="aboutme">
            <p>Hello!
                I am a motivated and analytical individual with a passion for data, software development, and machine
                learning. As a fresher, I have pursued academic studies and self-learning opportunities to develop a
                strong foundation in these fields.
                In my studies, I have acquired skills in data analysis, software development, and machine learning. I
                have worked with SQL, Python, Tableau, and other tools, and have a solid understanding of statistical
                models and their applications. I have also pursued software development through self-learning and have
                honed my skills in languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

                In machine learning, I have taken online courses and worked on personal projects, gaining experience
                with TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. I have a good understanding of the various applications of machine
                learning models, including image classification, natural language processing, and predictive analysis.
                I am eager to bring my skills and passion for these fields to a professional setting and am confident
                that my academic background, self-learning, and strong work ethic make me a strong candidate for any
                organization looking for a data analyst, software developer, or machine learning enthusiast.</p>
