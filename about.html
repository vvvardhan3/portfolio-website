        <div class="about-content">
            <h3>Childhood Days</h3>
            <p>My childhood was like a science experiment gone hilariously wrong! Academics? Let's just say I gave
                them a run for their money. While others were mastering ABCs, I was busy trying to understand my own
                version of a mysterious chemical equation. Yes, those chemicals that every Indian house has, I mixed
                them like a mad scientist. Sparks flew, but not in the way you'd expect!. 
                I tried building my own electronic motors - little did I know they'd spin me in circles. 
                Batteries became my friends, and I learned that when they ran out of juice, they're worse than grumpy morning people. 
                I also dabbled with lights, trying to make them blink like a disco party for ants!</p><br>
            <p>I was a master of playing with electrical sockets. Some kids had dolls, I had sockets. I'd stare at
                    them like they were a puzzle waiting to be solved. I even tried reverse engineering my electronic toys
                    because why not? And learning my mother tongue, Telugu? Oh boy, my tongue had a mind of its own! But
                    hey, my passion for music matched my passion for mangling Telugu, so it was a good trade-off. Cricket,
                    well, that was my second religion. I played, watched, and probably dreamed of becoming a cricketer one day. My friends
                    couldn't decide if I was more obsessed with hitting a six or singing a song!</p>
            <h3>School Life</h3>
            <p>My school life at Sri Chaitanya Techno School was marked by memorable experiences and academic
                achievements. I actively participated in various extracurricular activities and developed a keen
                interest in mathematics and science.</p>
            <h3>Intermediate Days</h3>
            <p>My intermediate education at Sree Narayana College further nurtured my passion for learning and
                exploration. I was exposed to a diverse range of subjects that laid the groundwork for my
                academic journey in computer science.</p>
            <h3>Bachelor's Degree</h3>
            <p>Studying computer science engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University was a transformative
                experience. I delved into programming, algorithms, and software development, honing my skills and
                fostering a deep appreciation for technology.</p>
            <h3>Master's Degree</h3>
            <p>Pursuing a master's degree in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro has
                allowed me to broaden my horizons. Collaborating with diverse peers and diving into advanced
                topics has fueled my passion for innovation and problem-solving.</p>
